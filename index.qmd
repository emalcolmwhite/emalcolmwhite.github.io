**Hi there!** üëã

I‚Äôm an educator who believes every student ‚Äî especially those unsure they belong ‚Äî deserves to feel seen, supported, and capable. I use creativity, care, and intentionality to make math and computing more approachable and human. I create learning experiences and systems that are welcoming, empowering, and help students see what‚Äôs possible for themselves. 

At Middlebury College, I teach a range of courses, including statistics, data science, and mathematics. I also serve as the Interim Director of the Quantitative Center (Q-Center), a growing initiative dedicated to supporting Middlebury students in developing the quantitative skills they need to thrive - in the classroom and beyond.

Every year, I co-teach [‚ÄúR by the Sea‚Äù](r-by-the-sea.html), a hands-on data science workshop for marine ecologists. It's a great way to connect data science with real-world questions in marine ecology.
