**Hi there!** 👋

I’m an educator and student support specialist with a passion for teaching and developing quantitative skills for students from a wide variety of backgrounds. I’m deeply committed to creating an inclusive and equitable learning environment where all students can thrive.

At Middlebury College, I teach a range of courses, including statistics, data science, and mathematics. I also serve as the Interim Director of the Quantitative Center (Q-Center), a new initiative dedicated to supporting students in developing their quantitative skills.

Every year, I co-teach [“R by the Sea”](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/r-by-the-sea/), a hands-on data science workshop for marine ecologists, at Shoals Marine Lab. It’s a rewarding opportunity to merge data science education with real-world applications in marine ecology.
