Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am an educator and student support specialist with a love for developing and teaching mathematics, statistics, and data science courses.

I believe that STEM education should be inclusive and accessible for all. I hope to minimize barriers for all students, including those with varying academic backgrounds, those with responsibilities outside of academics, and those with disabilities. I take the time to learn about innovative and effective teaching pedagogy and like to keep trying new things to maximize my effectiveness as an instructor.
