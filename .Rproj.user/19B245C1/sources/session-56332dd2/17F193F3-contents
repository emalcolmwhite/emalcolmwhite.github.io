# A few basics

**What is a string?**

- datatype we use to represent text
- use " " 

**Examples of strings:**

- "Hello world" 
- "5678"
- "blah blah blah"

** NOT a string:**

- 5678

# Using `stringr`

[`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) is a package containing a bunch of functions that help us work with strings. We'll discuss how to detect, remove, extract, and count words/characters/phrases from a string. We'll also talk about how to slice a string to get only the parts (aka the substrings) of it that you want.
  
[**`stringr` cheat sheet**](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf)

`stringr` is contained within the `tidyverse` package. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

**I'm registering for classes this Spring and am trying to decide what to take.**
Let's look at the course catalog!

Read in the courses data.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
courses <- read_csv("Fall23courses.csv")
```
    
## `str_detect` 

![artwork by @allisonhorst](https://cdn.myportfolio.com/45214904-6a61-4e23-98d6-b140f8654a40/813129dc-25e9-4ea3-9d03-262401faefba_rw_1200.png?h=e33a9402181e738d792b78e04cf4a6bc)
  
**inputs**: - string
            - pattern
            
**output**: - TRUE/FALSE

little example:
```{r}
str_detect("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", "data")
```
```{r}
str_detect("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", "pineapple")
```


I only want to take classes in Warner! 
```{r}
courses %>% 
  filter(str_detect(location, "WNS"))
```
  
  
Suppose I don't want any classes on Friday. Let's use `str_detect` to find our options.

```{r}
notFriday <- courses %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(meet, "Friday"))
```


Perhaps I'm interested in immigration.  
  
The `regex` function is used to write regular expressions in R. Regular expressions are helpful if you want to search for a pattern rather than a specific word or phrase.  

For now, we will only use regex to ignore capitalization.

If you're interested in using regular expressions at some point, this [regex cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/) will be super helpful.

```{r}
immigrationclasses <- courses %>% 
  filter(str_detect(description, regex("immigration", ignore_case=TRUE)))

immigrationclasses
```
  
## `str_extract` and `str_remove`
  
**str_extract inputs**: - string
                        - pattern
**str_extract output**: - the extracted pattern, if it appears in the the string

**str_remove inputs**:  - string
                        - pattern
**str_extract output**:  - the string without the pattern, if it appears in the string

little example:
```{r}
str_extract("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", "data")

str_extract_all("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", "data")

str_remove("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", "data")

str_remove_all("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", "data")
```
  
  
  
CW is part of the distribution requirement column. I want CW to be its own column.  

```{r}
courses %>% 
  mutate(CW = str_extract(distros, "CW")) %>% 
  mutate(distros = str_remove(distros, "CW"))
```
  
  
  
## `str_sub`
  
  
**str_sub inputs**: - string   
                    - starting character 
                    - ending character
**str_sub output**: - string with only the characters between the start and the end   
  
little example:
```{r}
str_sub("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", start=12, end=23) 
```

Maybe I only want 200 level math classes.  

- First we filter for just math classes. 
- Then we can create a new column called `level` that contains only the sixth character from the `courses` column.  

We call this a **substring**, hence the function `str_sub`.  


```{r}
MathClasses <- courses %>% 
  filter(department == "Mathematics") %>% 
  mutate(level=str_sub(courseNum, start=6, end=6)) 

Math2Classes <- MathClasses %>% 
  filter(level== "2")
```
  
  
## `str_count`

**str_count inputs**: - string  
                      - pattern
**str_count output**: - a count of the number of times the pattern appears in the string
  
  
little example:
```{r}
str_count("Welcome to data science, look at this cool data", "data")
```
 

Maybe I only want my classes to meet twice a week.
```{r}

courses <- courses %>% 
  mutate(dayCount = str_count(meet, "day"))

#what's the maximum number of days a week a class meets?
max(courses$dayCount)

#what's the mean number of days?
mean(courses$dayCount)

```

Let's visualize this data.
```{r}
courses %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=dayCount), fill="blue") + 
  xlab("Number of Days Class Meets") + 
  ylab("Number of Classes") + 
  labs(title="How many Days a Week do Classes at Middlebury Meet?")+
  theme_classic()
```

# Another useful function `str_squish`

`str_squish` is used to remove leading, trailing, and repeated interior whitespaces from strings
