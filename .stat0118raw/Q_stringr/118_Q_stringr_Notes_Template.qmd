# A few basics

**What is a string?**

- datatype we use to represent text
- use " " 

**Examples of strings:**

- 

** NOT a string:**

# Using `stringr`

[`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) is a package containing a bunch of functions that help us work with strings. We'll discuss how to detect, remove, extract, and count words/characters/phrases from a string. We'll also talk about how to slice a string to get only the parts (aka the substrings) of it that you want.
  
[**`stringr` cheat sheet**](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf)

`stringr` is contained within the `tidyverse` package. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

**I'm registering for classes this Spring and am trying to decide what to take.**
Let's look at the course catalog!

Read in the courses data.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
courses <- read_csv("Fall23courses.csv")
```
    
## `str_detect`

**inputs**: - string
            - pattern
            
**output**: - TRUE/FALSE

little example:
```{r}

```

```{r}

```


I only want to take classes in Warner! 
```{r}

```
  
  
Suppose I don't want any classes on Friday. Let's use `str_detect` to find our options.

```{r}

```


Perhaps I'm interested in immigration.  
  
The `regex` function is used to write regular expressions in R. Regular expressions are helpful if you want to search for a pattern rather than a specific word or phrase.  

For now, we will only use regex to ignore capitalization.

If you're interested in using regular expressions at some point, this [regex cheat sheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/) will be super helpful.

```{r}

```
  
## `str_extract` and `str_remove`
  
**str_extract inputs**: - string
                        - pattern
**str_extract output**: - the extracted pattern, if it appears in the the string

**str_remove inputs**:  - string
                        - pattern
                        
**str_extract output**:  - the string without the pattern, if it appears in the string

little example:
```{r}

```
  
  
  
CW is part of the distribution requirement column. I want CW to be its own column.  

```{r}

```
  
  
  
## `str_sub`
  
  
**str_sub inputs**: - string   
                    - starting character 
                    - ending character
                    
**str_sub output**: - string with only the characters between the start and the end   
  
little example:
```{r}

```

Bounds are inclusive!

Maybe I only want 200 level math classes.  

- First we filter for just math classes. 
- Then we can create a new column called `level` that contains only the sixth character from the `courses` column.  

We call this a **substring**, hence the function `str_sub`.  


```{r}

```
  
  
## `str_count`
  
**str_count inputs**: - string  
                      - pattern
**str_count output**: - a count of the number of times the pattern appears in the string
  
little example:
```{r}

```
 
Maybe I only want my classes to meet twice a week.
```{r}

```

Let's visualize this data.
```{r}

```

# Another useful function `str_squish`

`str_squish` is used to remove leading, trailing, and repeated interior whitespaces from strings
