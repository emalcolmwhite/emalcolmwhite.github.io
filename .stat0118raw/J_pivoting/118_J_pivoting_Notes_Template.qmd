# Reshaping with Pivoting -- Why? 

Data frames are often described as wide or long. 

*Wide* when a row has more than one observation, and the units of observation are on one row each

*Long* when a row has only one observation, but the units of observation are repeated down the column

# `canlang` dataset 

```{r}
#LOAD PACKAGES
library(tidyverse)

#LOAD DATA
lang_wide <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience/master/data/region_lang_top5_cities_wide.csv")
```

# Pivot Longer

```{r}

```


The data above is now tidy because all three criteria for tidy data have now been met:

- All the variables (category, language, region and mother_tongue) are now their own columns in the data frame.
- Each observation, (i.e., each language in a region) is in a single row.
- Each value is a single cell, i.e., its row, column position in the data frame is not shared with another value.

# Pivot Wider

```{r}
lang_long <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience/master/data/region_lang_top5_cities_long.csv")
```

# Gapminder

```{r}
library(gapminder)
data("gapminder")
```

Let’s say we’d like to look at `LifeExp` over time for all the countries in Asia in our dataset. 

```{r}
# Create a dataset called asia with the data we need

```

We can create a wide version of our table, where each row is a country and each column a year, with values of `lifeExp` in each cell of the table.

```{r}

```
