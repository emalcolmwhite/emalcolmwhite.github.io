```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#LOAD PACKAGES 
library(tidyverse)
```

We will be utilizing the gapminder dataset

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```


# 1. 

Create a static scatterplot using ggplot2 where:

- X-axis = GDP per capita (gdpPercap)
- Y-axis = Life expectancy (lifeExp)
- Size of each point = Population (pop)
- Color = Continent
- Use scale_x_log10() for GDP for better spacing.

You should use all years to create the plot. 

```{r}

```

# 2. 

Use gganimate to animate your plot over time. Add a `labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}")` to show the changing year in the title. You will need to save your animation locally to your computer as a .gif file. 

```{r}
#| cache: TRUE



#anim <- animate(p, ...)
#anim_save("gapminder.gif", anim)
```


# 3. 
Embed the the .gif back into this document using the following. You don't need to do anything here except check that your .gif is being embedded properly.
