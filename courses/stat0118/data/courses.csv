In this course, we will explore the history and evolution of American tourism, beginning in the 1820s, when middle-class tourists first journeyed up the Hudson River valley, and ending with our contemporary and continuing obsession with iconic destinations such as Graceland, Gettysburg, and the Grand Canyon. We will explore how the growth of national transportation systems, the development of advertising, and the rise of a middle class with money and time to spend on leisure shaped the evolution of tourism.  Along the way, we will study various types of tourism (such as historical, cultural, ethnic, eco-, and 'disaster' tourism) and look at the creative processes by which places are transformed into 'destinations'.  Our texts will come from visual art, travel literature, material culture, and film and television.  We will consider their cultural meaning and reflect on our own motivations and responses as tourists, and by so doing contemplate why tourism was-and still is-such an important part of American life. 3 hrs. lect.

Time travel, aliens, androids, robots, corporate and political domination, reimaginings of race, gender, sexuality and the human body--these concerns have dominated science fiction over the last 150 years.  But for all of its interest in the future, science fiction tends to focus on technologies and social problems relevant to the period in which it is written. In this course, we'll work to understand both the way that authors imagine technology's role in society and how those imaginings create meanings for science and its objects of study and transformation.  Some likely reading and films include Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, H. G. Wells, The Island of Doctor Moreau, Ridley Scott, Blade Runner, and works by William Gibson, Ursula LeGuin, Octavia Butler and other contemporary writers.

Using a combination of historical and ethnomusicological analysis, we will consider how and why music has been used for social influence in various historical moments. Topics may include 19th century campaign songs; music and abolitionism; folk ballads as a mechanism for social control; the political uses of country music; the protest songs and freedom songs of the 1960s; rock ‘n’ roll as social protest; and the cultural work of hip-hop.

But the increasing power of medicine has also raised nightmarish possibilities of lives controlled, squandered, or sacrificed to a system that often alienates patients, is centered on profit, and has a long history of treating marginal populations recklessly. How do science fiction writers, doctors, film makers, memoirists, and healthcare corporations portray an ever more medicalized vision of human experience and human bodies?

Sub-Saharan Africa has long represented primitive mysteries for Europeans and North Americans, as a ‘Dark Continent’ full of exotic people and animals. Even now, many Americans learn little about Africa and Africans except for ‘thin’ media reports of political, economic, and ecological upheaval or persistent poverty, disease, and despair. This course provides a ‘thick’ description and analysis of contemporary African conditions using ethnographies and films. We will not be exploring ‘traditional African cultures’ outside of their historical contexts or generalizing about ‘what African culture really is.’ Rather, our focus will be on understanding social continuity and change alongside cultural diversity and commonality. Topics will include colonialism, critical kinship studies, African feminism, environmental management, witchcraft and religion. Throughout the course African ideas of power – what it is, who has it, and why –unify these diverse topics as social relations. (formerly SOAN 0232) 3 hrs. lect.

When you look at a plant, what do you see? One might observe that plants are green, and they don’t move. Some might question whether plants are truly alive. In this course, we will challenge the notion that plants experience the world passively. Inside a plant, there are many highly active, dynamic processes by which a plant senses aspects of its environment and initiates complex responses that allow it to defend itself, alert its neighbors, or overcome harsh environments. Specifically, in this course we will focus on multiple aspects of plant molecular physiology, including major hormonal responses, developmental stages, vascular transport, nutrient acquisition, and metabolism, all in the context of building our understanding of the genes and proteins that catalyze these essential processes. The lab portion of this course will introduce students to common methods used by plant geneticists to test gene function, including mutational analysis, molecular cloning, and plant transformation, among others.

In this course we will explore the literary genre of romance.  Today, “romance” often refers to courtship—only one aspect of this ancient genre.  Other aspects include adventure, magic, wonder, multiple plots, multiple authors, an affinity for sequels.  Romance’s associations with every genre—tragedy, comedy, epic, novel, lyric poetry—and its reputation for escapism have made it an epitome of the very idea of literature, as conceived by attackers and defenders.  Its welcoming of female readers and protagonists and its marketing of the exotic have raised issues of gender and ethnicity.  We will discuss all such aspects and implications of romance, and we may also explore how romance has shaped modern television and film. No papers or exams; there will be quizzes daily on the reading, and students will be expected to participate thoughtfully in class discussions.

In this course we will focus on the health care system of the United States. We will apply standard microeconomic tools to the problems of health and health care markets. The course provides the fundamental tools with which to understand how the health care market is different from the markets for other goods. For example, students will learn about the dominant presence of uncertainty at all levels of health care, the government's unusually large presence in the market, the pronounced difference in knowledge between doctors and patients, and the prevalence of situations where the actions of some impose costs or benefits on others (e.g., vaccinations, drug research).

In this course regression analysis is introduced. The major focus is on quantifying relationships between economic variables. Multiple regression identifies the effect of several exogenous variables on an endogenous variable. After exploring the classical regression model, fundamental assumptions underlying this model will be relaxed, and further new techniques will be introduced. Methods for testing hypotheses about the regression coefficients are developed throughout the course. Both theoretical principles and practical applications will be emphasized. The course goal is for each student to employ regression analysis as a research tool and to justify and defend the techniques used.

Why read literature? One answer: such reading is not individual but communal. It links readers to each other in aesthetic experience, in ethical and hermeneutic debate, and in appreciation for writers and fellow readers. As we read literary texts from different times, cultures, and genres, we will examine how they anticipate, create, or recreate readerly communities, and how these communities in turn help shape the texts as they are experienced. We will also strive to form our own readerly community—one that is as inclusive and as intellectually generous as possible. We will begin with close analysis of poetry in various forms from various historical periods. We will then read dramas by such playwrights as William Shakespeare, Margaret Edson, and/or Lolita Chakrabarti, as well as two works from among such prose writers as Charles Dickens, Emily Brontë, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, Marilynne Robinson, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, Ian McEwan, Walter Moseley, and Jean Rhys. 3 hrs. lect./disc ",ENGL0103A-F25,"Monday, Wednesday (Sep 8, 2025 to Dec 8, 2025)"

We will consider the ways in which writers identifying as female respond to--and often subvert--traditional literary themes and conventions. An organizing focus of our reading will be the articulation or suppression of female anger and other related emotions in a variety of repressive contexts.

In this course we will explore the literary genre of romance.  Today, “romance” often refers to courtship—only one aspect of this ancient genre.  Other aspects include adventure, magic, wonder, multiple plots, multiple authors, an affinity for sequels.  Romance’s associations with every genre—tragedy, comedy, epic, novel, lyric poetry—and its reputation for escapism have made it an epitome of the very idea of literature, as conceived by attackers and defenders.  Its welcoming of female readers and protagonists and its marketing of the exotic have raised issues of gender and ethnicity.  We will discuss all such aspects and implications of romance, and we may also explore how romance has shaped modern television and film. No papers or exams; there will be quizzes daily on the reading, and students will be expected to participate thoughtfully in class discussions.

In this course students work in small groups with one of a variety of partners and organizations to complete a semester-long, community-engaged project. Project themes vary by term and typically focus on local and regional environmental issues that have broader application. Projects rely on students’ creativity, interdisciplinary perspectives, skills, and knowledge developed through their previous work. The project is guided by a faculty member and carried out with a high degree of independence by the students. Students will prepare for and direct their project work through readings and discussion, independent research, collaboration with project partners, and consultation with external experts. The course may also include workshops focused on developing key skills (e.g., interviewing, public speaking, video editing). The project culminates in a public presentation of students’ final products, which may various forms such as written reports, policy white papers, podcasts, or outreach materials.

We will consider recent curatorial strategies to address the challenges of representing African art in museums, examining the categories of contemporary vs. “traditional” art, questions of authenticity, the art market’s influence on museum collections, issues of provenance and repatriation, and efforts to decolonize the museum. Culminating in an imaginary exhibit, the course probes the past and the present to introduce students to the theoretical and practical aspects of museology.

High quality design succeeds through problem solving and iteration. In this studio course, students first each identify a problem and devise a solution that that uses high-tech equipment like CNC fabrication, robotics, 3D printing, laser cutting, or 2D/3D graphics. They also build a production calendar with at least two design iterations toward a final deliverable. And then they head out on the adventure of project work where they discover the unforeseen surprises, knowledge and experience gaps, and calendar setbacks that define serious design work. The outcome is a final deliverable in metal, wood, plastic, or pixels. ",HARC0377A-F25,"Monday, Wednesday (Sep 8, 2025 to Dec 8, 2025)"

In this course we will examine how art was recruited in Sweden’s self-fashioning as a modern European state through the lens of museum studies and histories of collecting. Gustav Vasa, founder of the protestant Church of Sweden and the country’s first hereditary monarchy, is often called the father of the modern Swedish state, and Vasa’s descendants ruled during a key period of Swedish cultural history. By examining key objects and monuments commissioned for, gifted to, or looted by the House of Vasa (1523-1648) and those close to them, we will consider how power is buttressed and imaged by material culture.

In this course, we will explore the social and cultural history of Jews and Judaism at Middlebury College and Vermont through two interconnected frameworks. The first framework employs the college's archives to analyze Middlebury as a case study of Jews in American higher education. We will review admission records and faculty minutes to outline institutional policies concerning Jewish students and faculty and explore the representation of Jews and Judaism in the curriculum and campus life. To provide a longitudinal perspective on contemporary issues, we will revisit campus debates concerning Israel/Palestine and antisemitism and examine their impact on inter-communal relations. The second framework centers on local history to study Vermont's Jewish communities, rural Jewish life, and movements such as the back-to-the-land movement, including visits to local archives and historical sites. This course is part of the Special Collections Collaborative Public Humanities Labs Initiative supported by the Axinn Center for the Humanities and Special Collections.

Historically, much psychological research has focused on the United States and has aimed to interpret human psychological processes without reference to their cultural contexts. Cultural psychology, by contrast, holds that culture is essential for human psychology as we know it. The goal of this course is to understand that premise. Drawing on new research insights from around the globe, we will explore cross-cultural variations in psychological functioning from emotions, cognitions, and perceptions, to development, personality, and mental health. We will analyze where cultural variations come from, how the mind becomes enculturated, and the sense in which human nature is cultural.

Students will learn object-based research methods to investigate the social meanings and uses of everyday objects. (SOCI majors only and others by permission.)

This course is an intensive exploration of the evolution of the theory and practice of theatrical experimentation in the 20th and 21st centuries. The Modernist movement irrevocably altered the artist’s relationship to the social, and political order. The ramifications of this change will be addressed throughout the course, with particular emphasis on Brecht, Artaud, and Grotowski. Students will write papers and give presentations on the work of such contemporary artists as Peter Brook, DV8, Robert Wilson, Ariane Mnouchkine, Complicite and Jerzy Grotowski.

Power: who has it, who doesn’t, and what does it have to do with your writing? This course both instructs students in how to access power in academic contexts and to critique power structures. We’ll learn how power connects to literacy, and how it's shaped through rhetorical contexts. Students will explore their own power as writers and thinkers while engaging in meaningful personal, reflective and argumentative writing. The professor will work with each student extensively on their writing process and development, and we'll create a writing community. This course bears elective credit but does not fulfill the college writing requirement. 3 hrs. lect/disc (Students who have already taken WRPR 0101 cannot take this course again.)
