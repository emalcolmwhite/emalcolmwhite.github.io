To access map data for New Zealand use the code: `nz_maps <- map_data(\"world\", region = \"New Zealand\")`. You may need to subset the latitude and longitude coordinates to get a great map of New Zealand. The land should be some shade of orange. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n# Use the `sf` package\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#LOAD DATA\nlibrary(spData) #this packages contains the dataset (with sf objects) that we will be using today\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,\nwhich was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.\nPlease refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially\nhttps://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.\nIt may be desirable to make the sf package available;\npackage maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.\nThe sp package is now running under evolution status 2\n     (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nTo access larger datasets in this package, install the spDataLarge\npackage with: `install.packages('spDataLarge',\nrepos='https://nowosad.github.io/drat/', type='source')`\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"nz\")\ndata(\"us_states\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 2.\nUse the `sf` package to create a map of New Zealand. To access `sf` geometries for New Zealand use the \"nz\" dataset loaded above. The land should be some shade of orange. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 3.\nName two differences between the two New Zealand maps you created above. \n\n# 4. \nUse the `us_states` dataset from above to create a map of the US States. All the land map should be some shade of red. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 5. \nThe `us_states` dataset has a column `REGION` which indicates whether the state is \"Northeast\", \"Midwest\", \"South\", or \"West\". Create a map which shades each state depending on the REGION it is located in.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 6.\nCreate a cloropleth map which colors each state depending on the total population of that state in 2015 (`total_pop_15` column in the `us_states` dataset). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nSuppose we wish to incorporate data from another source on each state. This will require us to join the `sf` data with another dataset (remember joins from before?). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#dataset which contains information about each state\ndata(state) \nstate_data <- data.frame(state.x77)\n#weirdly, the state names are listed as row names instead of in their own column. The below code fixes this. \nstate_data$NAME <- rownames(state_data)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 7. \nJoin together the `state_data` dataset with the `sf` data housed in `us_states` into a new dataset called `states_map_data`. The key variable is the state name. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 8. \nWhat data is in `state_data` that isn't in `us_states`? What data is in `us_states` that isn't in `state_data`?  \n\n# 9. \nIgnoring the fact that we lost one row, use your new dataset `states_map_data` (from 7) to create a cloropleth map which colors each state depending on the illiteracy rate in 1970 as a percent of the population (`Illiteracy`). Use any color palette you like. ",
