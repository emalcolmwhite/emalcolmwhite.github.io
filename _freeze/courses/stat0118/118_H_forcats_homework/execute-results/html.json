The survey has thousands of questions, but `gss_cat` only contains the 9 variables.   \n\nBegin by reading more about each variable in the dataset by typing `?gss_cat` into the console. \n\n# 1.  \nFor each categorical/factor variable in `gss_cat` identify whether the order of the levels is ordinal or nominal. \n\nmarital - \nrace - \nrincome - \npartyid - \nrelig - \ndenom - \n\n\n# 2. \nWhat are the levels of the variable `partyid`? Create a table which displays how many people are in each category of `partyid`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 3. \nConstruct a barplot which displays `partyid` on the x-axis and the the height of the bars represents the count of how many people fall in each category. What makes the default bar chart hard to understand? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 4.\nRegroup `partyid` variable to only contain four groups: \"rep\", \"ind\", \"dem\", and \"other\". Recreate the barchart above with your improved groupings. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 5.\nWhat are the levels of the `relig` variable? Create a table which counts how many people belong to each religion. Be sure to print out your table is a pretty way using the `kableExtra` package. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 6. \nCreate a new variable in the dataset called `top_relig` which only contains the 5 most popular religions and all other categories are grouped into an \"other category\". Create table which counts the number of people in each `top_relig` category. Be sure to print out your table is a pretty way using the `xtable` package.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 7. \nExplore the relationship between marital status and the number of TV hours watched. Your results should include an appropriate plot that is well-labelled. Pay attention to the ordering of any categorical variables in your plot to ensure they are ordered in an appropriate way. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n# 8.\nExplore the relationship between one of the categorical variables in this dataset over time. Your results should include an appropriate plot  that is well-labelled. Pay attention to the ordering of any categorical variables in your plot to ensure they are ordered in an appropriate way. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
