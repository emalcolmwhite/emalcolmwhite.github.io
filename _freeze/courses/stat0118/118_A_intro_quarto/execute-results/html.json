It is recommended that you set up the file structure in the following way:\n\n![](images/file_structure.png){width=\"80%\"}\n\n::: callout-tip\nTo make your computer easier to organize, I *highly recommend* changing the settings on your web browser to ask you where you want to save files when you download (instead of just always downloading to your \"Downloads\" folder).\n\nThe process will vary from browser to browser, but guidelines for commonly used browsers are given below:\n\n**Google Chrome:**\n\n1.  Go to the three-dot menu (top-right corner) ‚Üí Settings.\n\n2.  Scroll down and click Downloads.\n\n3.  Toggle on ‚ÄúAsk where to save each file before downloading.‚Äù\n\n**Firefox:**\n\n1.  Click the three-line menu (top-right corner) ‚Üí Settings.\n\n2.  In the General section, under Files and Applications, select: ‚ÄúAlways ask you where to save files.‚Äù\n\n**Safari (Mac):**\n\n1.  Go to Safari \\> Preferences \\> General.\n\n2.  Under File download location, select: ‚ÄúAsk for each download.‚Äù\n:::\n\n# Rendering your .qmd file into a pretty .html file\n\n## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Your .qmd File in RStudio\n\nNavigate to the file on your local computer and click to open it!\n\n-   Some folks prefer to use the \"Files\" tab within RStudio to navigate to the file\n-   Other folks prefer to interact with their files in their typical way (Using Finder on Mac or File Explorer on PC)\n\nEither way works just fine!\n\n## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Quarto in RStudio\n\n**Option 1: Using the RStudio Interface**\n\n-   Go to the Packages pane in RStudio (bottom-right by default),\n-   Click Install,\n-   In the box that appears:\n    -   Enter the package name (`quarto`),\n        -   Make sure Install dependencies is checked,\n        -   Click Install.\n\n**Option 2: Using R Code in the Console**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"quarto\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Render and Preview\n\nClick the Render button (![](images/Render.png){width=\"20\"}) at the top-right of your RStudio editor window.\n\nTada! You now have created a .html file!\n\nThe file has been created in the same folder as your .qmd file: ![](images/file_structure_with_html.png){width=\"80%\"}\n\nWhen you render, a preview of the document will show up!\n\n::: callout-tip\nBy default, the preview of .html will pop up in your web browser. This is totally okay. In fact, I tend to prefer this approach when I'm working at a computer station with multiple monitors.\n\nHowever, you may prefer to have the .html preview in your viewer pane right within RStudio. This is what I prefer when I'm just working on just my laptop.\n\nClick on the \"gear button\" ![](images/gear.png){width=\"20\"} and select \"Preview in Viewer Pane\"\n:::\n\nThe preview will update whenever you re-render the document.\n",
