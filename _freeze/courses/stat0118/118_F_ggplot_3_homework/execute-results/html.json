Gapminder Scatterplot\n\n- For the year 2007, plot GDP per capita (x-axis) vs. life expectancy (y-axis).\n- Format large numbers as numbers with commas (not scientific notation)\n- color points by continent\n- Be sure your axes are clearly labelled for a general audience\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n# 2. Log-Transformed Gapminder Scatterplot\n\nTake your scatterplot from the previous problem. Log-transform the GDP per capita axis. Explain why a log-transformed x-axis is useful here. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 3. Gapminder Scatterplot with labels\n\nTake your scatterplot from the previous problem. Use `geom_text_repel()` to label the subset of countres which have a GDP per capita over over $40,000. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n# 4. Gapminder Scatterplot over the years\n\nRepeat this plot for all years in the dataset. Hint: you'll need to make sure you are using the full dataset for all years (not just 2007 like in the previous plots) AND you can use a nifty function that we talked about to repeat the analysis for all years in only one line of code! \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 5. Gapminder US Time Series\n\n- Create a time-series line plot for GDP per capita in the United States\n- Label the highest and lowest years using geom_text_repel(). \n- Be sure that the axis showing the GDP per capita is shown in currency format (with dollar signs!)\n- Be sure your axes are clearly labelled for a general audience\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 6. Explain using Gapminder US Time Series\n\nHow has GDP per capita in the U.S. changed over time? What major historical events might explain large shifts?\n\n\n\n",
