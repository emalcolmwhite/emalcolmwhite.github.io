Fun fact: pilots and flight attendents are only paid for block time, and that doesn't include boarding. Block time includes:\n\n- some time spent on the ground at the origin (doing safety checks, taxiing from the gate to the runway, waiting to get cleared to takeoff, etc.) \n- the amount of time in the air \n- some time spent on the ground at the destination (taxiing from the runway to the gate, etc.)\n\nCalculate a new column called `block_time` which is calculated by taking the `arrival_datetime` and subtracting the `departure_daterime`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n#6. \n\nCalculate a new column called `ground_time` which is calculated by taking the `block_time` and subtracting the `airtime`. Note that `airtime` is given in minutes and your calculated `ground_time` should also be given in minutes. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
