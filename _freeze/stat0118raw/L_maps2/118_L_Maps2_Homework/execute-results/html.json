All points should be the same size (choose an appropriate size and color). Your plot should include a title and appropriate colors. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 4.\nCreate an `ggplot` map (using `sf` objects) which displays the locations from your dataset as points on the map. Your points should vary in size depending on a quantitative variable in your data OR vary in color depending on a categorical variable in your data.
