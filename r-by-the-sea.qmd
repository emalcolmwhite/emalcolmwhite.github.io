## R by the Sea


I co-teach “R by the Sea”, a hands-on data science workshop for marine ecologists, with my husband Easton White who runs the [Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire](https://quantmarineecolab.github.io/). It’s a rewarding opportunity to merge data science education with real-world applications in marine ecology.
