```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#LOAD PACKAGES 
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#LOAD DATA 
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

#CLEAN UP DATA
penguins <- penguins %>%
  drop_na()
#sometimes this is appropriate. It's questionable here... 
```

# `mutate`

The mutate function allows you create a new column which is a function of other columns. This can be useful to converting units.

For example, let's calculate create a new column which displays the body length weight in pounds (lbs) instead of grams. Recall: to convert from grams to pounds we need to multiply by 0.00220462

```{r}

```

This can also be useful for making new calculations based on existing data (for example, price and number of square feet could be used to calculate price per square foot).

# `case_when`

Case when can be used in combination with `mutate` to create a new column with a categorical variable conditional on the values in another column.

For example:

```{r}

```

::: callout-tip
For those of you who have taken a computer science class before, you may notice that `case_when` is similar to using an `ifelse` statement. You can also use `ifelse` in R if you'd prefer!

```{r}
penguins <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(penguin_length_cat = ifelse(bill_length_mm > 50, 'whoa! huge bill!', '--' ))
```

# default printing style of a table

Let's consider our table from last class:

```{r}

```

When we knit this up it looks like of ugly...

# Using `kable` to get pretty tables

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}

```


# Options in kable

We customize the content so it's displaying the information more clearly.

```{r}

```

Better...

# pretty styling

```{r}

```

Many options for customizing the look of the tables -- more here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html>

Let's try one...

Let's make each row's color correspond to

```{r}

```

RStudio hosts a table contest every year!

-   Here is a link to this year's contest <https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-table-contest-2022/>
-   Here is a link to previous year's entries and winners to explore what is possible! <https://community.rstudio.com/c/table-gallery/64>

::: callout-tip
As a general rule, you should have the content of the table as you'd like it (the exact columns and rows you want) first and *then* you can make it pretty using the `kableExtra` package.
