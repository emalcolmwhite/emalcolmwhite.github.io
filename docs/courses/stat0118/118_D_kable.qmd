```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#LOAD PACKAGES 
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#LOAD DATA 
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

#CLEAN UP DATA
penguins <- penguins %>%
  drop_na()
#sometimes this is appropriate. It's questionable here... 
```


# default printing style of a table

Let's consider our table from last class:

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(average_bill_lenth = mean(bill_length_mm), 
            average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm))
```

When we knit this up it looks like of ugly...

# Using `kable` to get pretty tables

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm), 
            average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm)) %>% 
  kbl()

#OR 

table1 <- penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm), 
            average_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm))

kbl(table1)
```


# Options in kable

We customize the content so it's displaying the information more clearly.

```{r}
table1 %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Species", "Average Bill Length", "Average Bill Depth"), 
    caption = "Average Bill Characteristics by Species", 
    digits = 2)
```

Better...

# pretty styling

```{r}
table1 %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Species", "Average Bill Length", "Average Bill Depth"), 
    caption = "Average Bill Characteristics by Species", 
    digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Many options for customizing the look of the tables -- more here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html>

Let's try one...

Let's make each row's color correspond to

```{r}
table1 %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Species", "Average Bill Length", "Average Bill Depth"), 
    caption = "Average Bill Characteristics by Species", 
    digits = 2) %>%
  kable_paper() %>%
  column_spec(1, bold=T) %>%
  row_spec(2, color = "#c85bcc") %>%
  row_spec(3, color = "#067176") %>%
  row_spec(1, color = "#ff7501")
```

RStudio hosts a table contest every year!

-   Here is a link to previous year's entries and winners to explore what is possible! <https://community.rstudio.com/c/table-gallery/64>

::: callout-tip
As a general rule, you should have the content of the table as you'd like it (the exact columns and rows you want) first and *then* you can make it pretty using the `kableExtra` package.
