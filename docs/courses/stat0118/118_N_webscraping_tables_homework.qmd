# 1. 
Use `read_html` to read in all the HTML tables from [Vermont's Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont). Save this HTML code as `VT_html`

```{r}

```


# 2. 
Use the appropriate code to save the 1st table on this wikipedia page as a tibble in R with the name `Vermont_Table1`. Don't worry about cleaning it up.

```{r}

```


# 4. 
Use the appropriate code to scrape the table labelled [The population of Vermont by race: 2000â€“2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont). Save this table as tibble named `VT_population`


```{r}

```

# 5. 

Use the table above to recreate the table below. *Hint: You may need to revisit our lesson on pivoting!*

```{r}

```

# 6.

Scrape a table of your choice from Wikipedia. Try to pick a simple table with one header, unless you are feeling up for a challenge.  Be sure to print out the table for the grader to see. 

```{r}

```
