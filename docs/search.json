    "text": "Importing Data\nIn this class, we are going to be working with a dataset relating to the languages spoken at home by Canadian residents. Many Indigenous peoples exist in Canada with their own languages and cultures. Sadly, colonization has led to the loss of many of these languages. This data is a subset of data collected during the 2016 census.\nWhat is a .csv file?\nHow do we import it into R?\nUse read.csv()! Note that your data file (.csv) needs to be saved in the same folder as your notes template document (.qmd).\n\ncan_lang &lt;- read.csv(\"can_lang.csv\")\n\nAlternatively, you can download it directly from the internet. Github user ttimbers hosts this file to share with the public at the link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttimbers/canlang/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.csv\n\ncan_lang &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttimbers/canlang/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.csv\")\n\nLet’s take a look at this data for a minute to see what information has been recorded.\n\nhead(can_lang)\n\n\n\nInstalling and Using Packages\nSometimes everything we need (data, functions, etc) are not available in base R. In R, expert users will package up useful things like data and functions into packages that be download and used.\nFirst, you need to download the package from the right hand menu –&gt; You only need to do this once.\nIn each new .Rmd document, you need to call any packages you want to use but adding the code library(packagename) inside an R chunk.\nFor example, in this class we will use the tidyverse package a lot.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\ndplyr\nThere are actually many commonly used packages wrapped up inside one tidyverse package.\nToday we are specifically going to be talking about the package dplyr which is useful to manipulating data sets.\n\n\nfilter\nWe can use the filter function to extract rows from the data that have a particular characteristic.\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allisonhorst\n\n\nFor example, we may be interested in only looking at only the languages in this dataset that are Aboriginal languages.\nStart with the can_lang dataset, the pipe “%&gt;%” means apply the action on the following line to the previous line. In this case, pick out only the rows were the category variable is “Aboriginal languages”\n\ncan_lang  %&gt;%              \n  filter(category == \"Aboriginal languages\")   \n\nSome notes:\n\nthe aboriginal languages is text/categorical and so quotation marks are needed.\nR doesn’t care about whether they are double quotation marks (“) or single (’). They work the same.\nIf we don’t assign it to an object, then it just prints out for us to see!\n\nOftentimes, we want to take our subset and give it a new name. This takes our subset and assigns it to a new dataset called aboriginal_lang.\n\naboriginal_lang &lt;- can_lang  %&gt;%              \n  filter(category == \"Aboriginal languages\")  \n\nNotes:\n\nNotice if you assign it to an object that it doesn’t print out the contents.\nYou’ll see the new object in your environment on the top right —&gt;\nIf you click on the word aboriginal languages (not the blue play button) it will open the object so you can see what is saved inside.\n\nIt can also be used with numeric criteria.\nSuppose we want a list of all the languages in Canada that are spoken by less than 100 people as their mother tongue.\n\nrare_lang &lt;- can_lang  %&gt;%              \n  filter(mother_tongue &lt; 100) \n\nThe logical operators are given below:\n\n\n\nselect\nselect is used to extract only certain columns. For example, perhaps we only want to print out a list names of the aboriginal languages (language column).\n\naboriginal_lang %&gt;% \n  select(language)\n\nWe can combine criteria together as well in one command with multiple pipes:\n\ncan_lang %&gt;% \n  filter(category == \"Aboriginal languages\") %&gt;% \n  select(language)\n\n\n\narrange\nThe arrange function allows us to order the rows of the data frame by the values of a particular column.\nFor example, arrange all the aboriginal languages in canada by from most to least spoken as mother tongue.\n\naboriginal_lang %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(mother_tongue)) \n\nNote:\n\nuse arrange(variable) to go from least to most\nuse arrange(desc(variable)) to go from most to least, arrange(-variable) also works\n\n\n\nslice\nThe slice function will allow us to pick only a subset of the rows based on their numeric order (1st through last).\nFor example, if I want a list of the 10 most commonly spoken aboriginal languages.\n\naboriginal_lang %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(mother_tongue)) %&gt;% \n  slice(1:10) %&gt;% \n  select(language, mother_tongue) #optional\n\n\n\nBrain Break\nStudents at Allison Bernard Memorial High School in Eskasoni, Cape Breton recorded Paul McCartney’s Blackbird in their native Mi’kmaq language. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99-LoEkAA3w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
