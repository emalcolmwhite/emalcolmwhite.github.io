I hope to minimize barriers for all students, including those with varying academic backgrounds, those with responsibilities outside of academics, and those with disabilities. I take the time to learn about innovative and effective teaching pedagogy and like to keep trying new things to maximize my effectiveness as an instructor.\n\n\n University of Victoria | Victoria, BC, Canada MSc in Statistics | 2014\n University of Guelph | Guelph, ON, Canada BSc in Applied Mathematics and Statistics | 2012\n\n\n\nMiddlebury College | Faculty | 2019 - present\nUC Davis | Math Specialist | 2015 - 2019"
