Let’s filter for rows where we detect the word “Warner” in the location column.\nSuppose I don’t want any classes on Friday. Let’s use str_detect to find our options.\nPerhaps I’m interested in artificial intelligence. We can use str_detect to find course descriptions that mention artificial intelligence.\nThe regex function is used to write regular expressions in R. Regular expressions are helpful if you want to search for a pattern rather than a specific word or phrase.\nFor now, we will only use regex to ignore capitalization. If you’re interested in using regular expressions at some point, this regex cheat sheet will be super helpful."
