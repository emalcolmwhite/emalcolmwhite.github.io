    "text": "Logistics for Enrolled Students\n\nWe will meet virtually via Zoom during the first week (June 3 - June 8). Check your email for the Zoom link.\nWe transition to Shoals Marine Lab on Appledore Island for the second week of the course (June 10 - 17).\nCommunication for this class will primarily happen on Slack. We recommend that you download the mobile app for ease of communication while we are on island. Check your email for the invite link.\nYou should submit your homework assignments via Canvas. If, for whatever reason, you don’t have access to Canvas you should email your assignment submissions to Emily at emily.malcolmwhite@unh.edu.\n\n\n\nInstall R and RStudio\nTo access the course materials, you will need to have both R and RStudio installed on your computer. Follow the instructions available on the Posit website: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.\n\nNote that there are two programs you need to download. R (or base R) is the brains or the calculator working behind the scenes - to work with this directly is possible but it’s a bit messy. RStudio is an additional interface that makes it easier to organize your scripts, your plots, your objects, and your files in one window. Typically, we will open RStudio and work directly in that program but it’s important to also have R installed in the background.\n\nYou should install these two programs before our first class. There will be some time given during our first class to help troubleshoot any issues that might arise during installation.\n\n\n\nSchedule & Course Materials\n\nto download the .qmd files (Template, Homework) you should right click and “Save Link As…”\nto view the Notes, just left-click in the usual way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Date\n      Time\n      Letter\n      Topic\n      Notes\n      Template\n      Data\n      Desc\n      Homework\n      Videos\n    \n  \n  \n    Mon, June 3\n9:00 AM\n\nIntroduction and Welcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n10:45 AM\nA\nInstallation, Intro R, RMarkdown, File Paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n1:00 PM\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nasynch\n\nSlack Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Tue, June 4\n9:00 AM\nB\nNaming Objects, Wrangling data with `dplyr`:: `filter`, `select`, `arrange`\n\n\n\npossum.csv\n\n\n    \n10:45 AM\nC\nAggregating data with `summarize`, `group_by()`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n1:00 PM\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n8:00PM\n\nRock Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Wed, June 5\n9:00 AM\nD\nMaking plots with `ggplot2`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n10:45 AM\nE\nMore making plots with `ggplot2`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n1:00 PM\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nasynch\n\nSlack Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Thu, June 6\n9:00 AM\nF\nJoining\n\n\n\nco2.csv\n\n\n    \n10:45 AM\nG\nReshaping/Pivoting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n1:00 PM\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Fri, June 7\n9:00 AM\nH\nWorking with categorical data using `forcats`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n10:45 AM\nI\nWorking with dates using `lubridate`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n1:00 PM\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nasynch\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sat, June 8\n\n\nNo Class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sun, June 9\n\n\nNo Class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Mon, June 10\n1:45 PM\n\nArrive at Market St Dock in Portsmouth, NH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n2:45 PM\n\nBoat Departure to Shoals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Tue, June 11\n\nJ\nSeal Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nK\nSustainability Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Wed, June 12\n\nL\nLobsters / Time Series\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Thu, June 13\n\nM\nIntertidal / Regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Fri, June 14\n\n\nMaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sat, June 15\n\n\nWork on Final Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sun, June 16\n\n\nFinal Presentations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Mon, June 17\n10:30 AM\n\nBoat Departure back to Market St Dock in Portsmouth, NH"

    "text": "Importing Data\nIn this class, we are going to be working with the possum dataset which consists of nine morphometric measurements on each of 104 mountain brushtail possums, trapped at seven Australian sites from Southern Victoria to central Queensland.\nSource: Lindenmayer, D. B., Viggers, K. L., Cunningham, R. B., and Donnelly, C. F. 1995. Morphological variation among columns of the mountain brushtail possum, Trichosurus caninus Ogilby (Phalangeridae: Marsupiala). Australian Journal of Zoology 43: 449-458.\nWhat is a .csv file?\nHow do we import it into R?\n\n#possum.csv needs to be saved in the same directory as this file. \n#possum &lt;- read.csv(\"possum.csv\")\n\nAlternatively, you can download it directly from the DAAD package.\n\n#You need to install the DAAG package first. Then you can call it using the code below. \nlibrary(DAAG)\ndata(possum)\n\nLet’s take a look at this data for a minute to see what information has been recorded.\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\ncase observation number site one of seven locations where possums were trapped.

In R, expert users will package up useful things like data and functions into packages that be download and used.\nFirst, you need to download the package from the right hand menu –&gt; You only need to do this once.\nIn each new .Rmd document, you need to call any packages you want to use but adding the code library(packagename) inside an R chunk.\nFor example, in this class we will use the tidyverse package a lot.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\ndplyr\nThere are actually many commonly used packages wrapped up inside one tidyverse package.\nToday we are specifically going to be talking about the package dplyr which is useful to manipulating data sets.\n\n\nfilter\nWe can use the filter function to extract rows from the data that have a particular characteristic.\nFor example, we may be interested in only looking at female possums.\n\n#start with the possums dataset, the pipe \"%\" means apply the action on the following line to the previous line. In this case, pick out only the rows were the sex variable is \"f\" \n\n # %&gt;% == and then do this\n\npossum %&gt;%\n  filter(sex == \"f\")\n\n      case site   Pop sex age hdlngth skullw totlngth taill footlgth earconch\nC5       2    1   Vic   f   6    92.5   57.6     91.5  36.5     72.5     51.2\nC10      3    1   Vic   f   6    94.0   60.0     95.5  39.0     75.4     51.9\nC15      4    1   Vic   f   6    93.2   57.1     92.0  38.0     76.1     52.2\nC23      5    1   Vic   f   2    91.5   56.3     85.5  36.0     71.0     53.2\nC24      6    1   Vic   f   1    93.1   54.8     90.5  35.5     73.2     53.6\nC27      8    1   Vic   f   6    94.8   57.6     91.0  37.0     72.7     53.9\nC28      9    1   Vic   f   9    93.4   56.3     91.5  37.0     72.4     52.9\nC31     10    1   Vic   f   6    91.8   58.0     89.5  37.5     70.9     53.4\nC32     11    1   Vic   f   9    93.3   57.2     89.5  39.0     77.2     51.3\nC34     12    1   Vic   f   5    94.9   55.6     92.0  35.5     71.7     51.0\nC45     17    1   Vic   f   1    94.7   67.7     89.5  36.5     73.2     53.2\nC48     19    1   Vic   f   5    94.4   55.4     90.5  35.0     73.4     53.9\nC50     20    1   Vic   f   4    94.8   56.3     89.0  38.0     73.8     52.4\nC54     21    1   Vic   f   3    95.9   58.1     96.5  39.5     77.9     52.9\nC58     23    1   Vic   f   4    92.5   56.1     89.0  36.0     72.8     53.3\nC63     27    1   Vic   f   2    90.5   54.5     85.0  35.0     70.3     50.8\nA1      29    1   Vic   f   3    92.8   56.0     88.0  35.0     74.9     51.8\nA2      30    1   Vic   f   2    92.1   54.4     84.0  33.5     70.6     50.8\nA4      32    1   Vic   f   4    94.3   56.7     94.0  39.0     74.8     52.0\nBB17    37    2   Vic   f   2    89.3   54.8     82.5  35.0     71.2     52.0\nBB31    39    2   Vic   f   1    84.7   51.5     75.0  34.0     68.7     53.4\nBB33    40    2   Vic   f   3    91.0   55.0     84.5  36.0     72.8     51.4\nBB36    41    2   Vic   f   5    88.4   57.0     83.0  36.5       NA     40.3\nBB40    43    2   Vic   f   2    90.0   55.5     81.0  32.0     72.0     49.4\nWW4     50    3 other   f   5    91.6   56.4     88.0  38.0     65.0     47.2\nWW5     51    3 other   f   5    95.6   59.6     85.0  36.0     64.0     43.9\nWW7     53    3 other   f   3    93.1   58.1     91.0  38.0     67.4     46.0\nBR4     57    4 other   f   4    95.1   59.4     93.0  41.0     67.2     45.3\nBR7     60    4 other   f   2    91.3   57.7     88.0  39.0     63.1     47.0\nCD2     62    5 other   f   3    91.3   58.0     90.5  39.0     65.5     41.3\nCD3     63    5 other   f   6    92.0   56.4     88.5  38.0     64.1     46.3\nCD4     64    5 other   f   3    96.9   56.5     89.5  38.5     63.0     45.1\nCD5     65    5 other   f   5    93.5   57.4     88.5  38.0     68.2     41.7\nCD6     66    5 other   f   3    90.4   55.8     86.0  36.5     63.2     44.2\nCD10    70    5 other   f   7    91.9   56.4     87.0  38.0     65.4     44.1\nBSF1    74    6 other   f   4    88.7   52.0     83.0  38.0     61.5     45.9\nBSF9    82    6 other   f   4    86.0   54.0     82.0  36.5     60.7     42.9\nBSF10   83    6 other   f   3    90.0   53.8     81.5  36.0     62.0     43.3\nBSF13   86    6 other   f   3    88.2   53.2     86.5  38.5     60.3     43.7\nBTP3    88    7 other   f   2    89.6   58.0     87.5  38.0     66.7     43.5\nBTP15   99    7 other   f   3    93.3   56.2     86.5  38.5     64.8     43.8\nBTP19  102    7 other   f   6    92.4   55.0     89.0  38.0     63.5     45.4\nBTP21  104    7 other   f   3    93.6   59.9     89.0  40.0     67.6     46.0\n       eye chest belly\nC5    16.0  28.5  33.0\nC10   15.5  30.0  34.0\nC15   15.2  28.0  34.0\nC23   15.1  28.5  33.0\nC24   14.2  30.0  32.0\nC27   14.5  29.0  34.0\nC28   15.5  28.0  33.0\nC31   14.4  27.5  32.0\nC32   14.9  31.0  34.0\nC34   15.3  28.0  33.0\nC45   14.7  29.0  31.0\nC48   15.2  28.0  32.0\nC50   15.5  27.0  36.0\nC54   14.2  30.0  40.0\nC58   15.4  28.0  35.0\nC63   14.2  23.0  28.0\nA1    14.0  24.0  32.0\nA2    14.5  24.5  33.0\nA4    14.9  28.0  34.0\nBB17  13.6  28.0  31.5\nBB31  13.0  25.0  25.0\nBB33  13.6  27.0  30.0\nBB36  15.9  27.0  30.5\nBB40  13.4  29.0  31.0\nWW4   14.9  28.0  36.0\nWW5   17.4  28.0  38.5\nWW7   16.5  26.0  33.5\nBR4   14.5  31.0  39.0\nBR7   14.4  26.0  30.0\nCD2   16.0  27.0  32.0\nCD3   15.2  25.5  28.5\nCD4   17.1  25.5  33.0\nCD5   14.0  29.0  38.5\nCD6   15.7  26.5  34.0\nCD10  13.0  27.0  34.0\nBSF1  14.7  26.0  34.0\nBSF9  15.4  26.0  32.0\nBSF10 14.0  25.0  29.0\nBSF13 13.6  26.0  31.0\nBTP3  16.0  25.5  31.5\nBTP15 14.0  28.0  35.0\nBTP19 13.0  25.0  30.0\nBTP21 14.8  28.5  33.5\n\n##note the sex is text/categorical and so quotation marks are needed. \n##R doesn't care about whether they are double quotation marks (\") or single (').

There are three relevant data types when we talk about date/time data:\n\nDate - only has the date (e.g. 2020-05-15)\nTime - only has the time (e.g. 20:45:00)\nDatetime - has both the date and time (e.g. 2020-05-15 20:45:00)\n\n\n\nStandard Date Format\nThe ymd() function transforms data in all kinds of different formats into a standardized date format displaying year, then month, then day.\n\nymd(\"06 02 04\")\n\n[1] \"2006-02-04\"\n\nymd(\"06/02/04\")\n\n[1] \"2006-02-04\"\n\nymd(\"20060204\")  # works as well\n\n[1] \"2006-02-04\"\n\nymd(\"2006 2 4\")\n\n[1] \"2006-02-04\"\n\nymd(060204)  # works with numbers\n\n[1] \"2006-02-04\"\n\n\nmdy() (month day year) and dmy() (day month year) formats also exist.\n\nymd_hms(\"2020-04-01 10:30:13\")\n\n[1] \"2020-04-01 10:30:13 UTC\"\n\nymd_hm(\"2020/04/01 10.30\")\n\n[1] \"2020-04-01 10:30:00 UTC\"\n\n\n\n\nMaking Dates From Values\n\n#make_date\n\n\n#make_datetime\n\n\n\nPortal Data\n\n#LOAD DATA\n#Recall the Portal Dataset\nportal_rodent &lt;- read.csv(\"https://github.com/weecology/PortalData/raw/main/Rodents/Portal_rodent.csv\")\n\nUnfortunately, because the information about datetime is divided up into different columns, R does not recognize it as date/time data. What we need to do is combine and convert all of these columns into datetime. To do this, we can use the function make_datetime()\n\n\nRounding Times\n\nt &lt;- ymd_hms(\"2022-11-15 00:08:30\")\n\n\n#Round\nround_date(t, unit = \"second\") #no change\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 00:08:30 UTC\"\n\nround_date(t, unit = \"minute\")\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 00:09:00 UTC\"\n\nround_date(t, unit = \"hour\")\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 UTC\"\n\nround_date(t, unit = \"day\")\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 UTC\"\n\n\n\n#Force Round UP\nceiling_date(t, unit = \"minute\")\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 00:09:00 UTC\"\n\nceiling_date(t, unit = \"hour\")\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 01:00:00 UTC\"\n\n\n\n#Force Round DOWN\nfloor_date(t, unit = \"minute\")\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 00:08:00 UTC\"\n\nfloor_date(t, unit = \"hour\")\n\n[1] \"2022-11-15 UTC\""

    "text": "Importing Data\nIn this class, we are going to be working with the possum dataset which consists of nine morphometric measurements on each of 104 mountain brushtail possums, trapped at seven Australian sites from Southern Victoria to central Queensland.\nSource: Lindenmayer, D. B., Viggers, K. L., Cunningham, R. B., and Donnelly, C. F. 1995. Morphological variation among columns of the mountain brushtail possum, Trichosurus caninus Ogilby (Phalangeridae: Marsupiala). Australian Journal of Zoology 43: 449-458.\nWhat is a .csv file?\nHow do we import it into R?\n\n#possum.csv needs to be saved in the same directory as this file. \n#possum &lt;- read.csv(\"possum.csv\")\n\nAlternatively, you can download it directly from the DAAD package.\n\n#You need to install the DAAG package first. Then you can call it using the code below. \n#library(DAAG)\n#data(possum)\n\nLet’s take a look at this data for a minute to see what information has been recorded.\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\ncase observation number site one of seven locations where possums were trapped. The sites were, in order,Cambarville, Bellbird, Whian Whian, Byrangery, Conondale, Allyn River and Bulburin Pop a factor which classifies the sites as Vic Victoria, other New South Wales or Queensland sex a factor with levels f female, m male age age hdlngth head length, in cm skullw skull width, in cm totlngth total length, in cm taill tail length, in cm footlgth foot length, in cm earconch ear conch length, in cm eye distance from medial canthus to lateral canthus of right eye, in cm chest chest girth, in cm belly belly girth, in cm\n\n\nInstalling and Using Packages\nSometimes everything we need (data, functions, etc) are not available in base R. In R, expert users will package up useful things like data and functions into packages that be download and used.\nFirst, you need to download the package from the right hand menu –&gt; You only need to do this once.\nIn each new .Rmd document, you need to call any packages you want to use but adding the code library(packagename) inside an R chunk.\nFor example, in this class we will use the tidyverse package a lot.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\ndplyr\nThere are actually many commonly used packages wrapped up inside one tidyverse package.\nToday we are specifically going to be talking about the package dplyr which is useful to manipulating data sets.\n\n\nfilter\nWe can use the filter function to extract rows from the data that have a particular characteristic.\nFor example, we may be interested in only looking at female possums.\n\n#start with the possums dataset, the pipe \"%\" means apply the action on the following line to the previous line. In this case, pick out only the rows were the sex variable is \"f\" \n\n\n\n##note the sex is text/categorical and so quotation marks are needed. \n##R doesn't care about whether they are double quotation marks (\") or single ('). They work the same. \n# If we don't assign it to an object, then it just prints out for us to see! \n\n\n#oftentimes, we want to take our subset and give it a new name. This takes our subset and assigns it to a new dataset called `possum_f`. \n\n\n\n#Notice if you assign it to an object that it doesn't print out the contents. \n# You'll see the new object in your environment on the top right ---&gt; \n# If you click on the word `possum_f` (not the blue play button) it will open the object so you can see what is saved inside. \n\nIt can also be used with numeric criteria.\nSuppose we want a list of all the possums whose total length is less than 80cm.\nThe logical operators are given below:\n\n\n\nselect\nselect is used to extract only certain columns. For example, perhaps we only want to print out a dataset with only the population, the sex, and the total length of each possum.\nWe can combine criteria together as well in one command with multiple pipes:\n\n\narrange\nThe arrange function allows us to order the rows of the data frame by the values of a particular column.\nFor example, arrange all the female possums by the longest length to the shortest total length\n\n#use arrange(variable) to go from least to most\n#use arrange(desc(variable)) to go from most to least, arrange(-variable) also works\n\n\n\nslice\nThe slice function will allow us to pick only a subset of the rows based on their numeric order (1st through last).\nFor example, if I want a list the 5 female possums with longest total lengths."

Categorical data is a type of data that consists of categories or labels.\nExamples of categorical data include:\n\nColors (red, blue, green, etc.)\nTypes of vehicles (sedan, SUV, truck)\nEducational degrees (high school, college, graduate school)\n\nCategorical data can be further divided into two types: nominal and ordinal. Nominal data consists of categories that have no inherent order, while ordinal data consists of categories that have a natural order. For example, educational degrees are ordinal data because they can be ordered from least to most advanced.\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(forcats)"
