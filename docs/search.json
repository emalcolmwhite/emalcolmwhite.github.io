    "text": "Hi there! 👋\nI’m an educator and student support specialist with a passion for teaching and developing quantitative skills for students from a wide variety of backgrounds. I’m deeply committed to creating an inclusive and equitable learning environment where all students can thrive.\nAt Middlebury College, I teach a range of courses, including statistics, data science, and mathematics. I also serve as the Interim Director of the Quantitative Center (Q-Center), a new initiative dedicated to supporting students in developing their quantitative skills.\nEvery year, I co-teach “R by the Sea”, a hands-on data science workshop for marine ecologists, at Shoals Marine Lab. It’s a rewarding opportunity to merge data science education with real-world applications in marine ecology."
