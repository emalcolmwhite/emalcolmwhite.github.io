    "text": "Installing and Using Packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n\nToday we are specifically going to be talking about the package dplyr which is useful to manipulating data sets.\n\n\ncan_lang dataset\nIn this class, we are going to be working with a dataset relating to the languages spoken at home by Canadian residents. Many Indigenous peoples exist in Canada with their own languages and cultures. Sadly, colonization has led to the loss of many of these languages. This data is a subset of data collected during the 2016 census.\n\n\nImporting Data\nWhat is a .csv file?\nHow do we import it into R?\nUse read.csv()! Note that your data file (.csv) needs to be saved in the same folder as your notes template document (.qmd).\n\n#can_lang &lt;- read.csv(\"can_lang.csv\") \n\nAlternatively, you can download it directly from the internet. Github user ttimbers hosts this file to share with the public at the link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttimbers/canlang/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.csv\n\n#can_lang &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttimbers/canlang/master/inst/extdata/can_lang.csv\") \n\nLet’s take a look at this data for a minute to see what information has been recorded. In the environment in the top left, if you click on the word can_lang (not the blue play button, the word itself) it will open the object so you can see what is saved inside.\n\n\nfilter()\nWe can use the filter function to extract rows from the data that have a particular characteristic.\nFor example, we may be interested in only looking at only the languages in this dataset that are Aboriginal languages.\nOftentimes, we want to take our subset and give it a new name. This takes our subset and assigns it to a new dataset called aboriginal_lang.\nSuppose we want a list of all the languages in Canada that are spoken by less than 100 people as their mother tongue.\nThe logical operators are given below:\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nLess than\n\n\n&gt;\nGreater than\n\n\n&lt;=\nLess than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;=\nGreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nEqual to\n\n\n!=\nNot equal to\n\n\n!x\nNot x\n\n\nx | y\nx OR y\n\n\nx & y\nx AND y\n\n\n\n\n\nselect()\nselect is used to extract only certain columns. For example, perhaps we only want to print out a list names of the aboriginal languages (language column).\nWe can combine criteria together as well in one command with multiple pipes:\n\n\narrange()\nThe arrange function allows us to order the rows of the data frame by the values of a particular column.\nFor example, arrange all the aboriginal languages in canada by from most to least spoken as mother tongue.\nNote:\n\nuse arrange(variable) to go from least to most\nuse arrange(desc(variable)) to go from most to least, arrange(-variable) also works\n\n\n\nslice()\nThe slice function will allow us to pick only a subset of the rows based on their numeric order (1st through last).\nFor example, if I want a list of the 10 most commonly spoken aboriginal languages.\n\n\nmutate()\nmutate() creates new columns that are functions of existing variables.\nFor example, if I want to create a new column called mother_tongue_K which represents the number of people who speak the language their mother tongue in thousands. You may want to save this new dataset over top of the original dataset so you could use this new column in the future.\nThis can be useful for unit conversions. It also be useful for making new calculations based on existing data (for example, price and number of square feet could be used to calculate price per square foot).\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Nominal data consists of categories that have no inherent order, while ordinal data consists of categories that have a natural order. For example, educational degrees are ordinal data because they can be ordered from least to most advanced."
